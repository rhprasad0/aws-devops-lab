# Week 9: Argo Rollout with Canary Strategy
#
# WHY use Rollout instead of Deployment?
# - Standard K8s Deployment: RollingUpdate replaces pods one by one, but ALL traffic
#   immediately goes to new pods as soon as they're ready
# - Argo Rollout: Controls actual TRAFFIC percentage to new version, allowing gradual
#   validation before full rollout
#
# HOW Canary works:
# 1. Deploy new "canary" pods alongside existing "stable" pods
# 2. Send small percentage of traffic (e.g., 20%) to canary
# 3. Monitor metrics/health during pause periods
# 4. Gradually increase traffic (40% → 60% → 100%)
# 5. If issues detected: automatic or manual rollback
# 6. If successful: promote canary to stable
#
# TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT OPTIONS:
# 1. Replica-based (used here): Argo scales canary replicas to achieve traffic ratio
#    - Simple, works without extra setup
#    - Less precise (depends on load balancer distribution)
# 2. ALB traffic splitting: Uses AWS ALB target group weights
#    - Precise traffic percentages
#    - Requires additional ALB ingress annotations (documented below)

  # Canary deployment strategy
  strategy:
    canary:
      # Service that receives canary traffic (for monitoring/testing)
      canaryService: guestbook-canary
      
      # Service that receives stable traffic
      stableService: guestbook
      
      # Canary steps - the rollout progression
      # Each step either sets traffic weight or pauses
      steps:
        # Step 1: Send 20% traffic to canary, pause for validation
        - setWeight: 20
        - pause: { duration: 30s }  # Auto-promote after 30s (use {} for manual promotion)
        
        # Step 2: Increase to 50%, pause again
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: { duration: 30s }
        
        # Step 3: Full rollout (implicit 100% after all steps)
        # The rollout automatically promotes to stable after all steps complete
      
      # Max unavailable during rollout (protect availability)
      maxUnavailable: 0
      
      # Max surge - how many extra pods can be created during rollout
      maxSurge: 1
      
      # Traffic routing configuration for ALB (optional, more precise)

      # trafficRouting:
      #   alb:
      #     ingress: guestbook
      #     servicePort: 80
      #     # Root service that owns the ALB ingress
      #     rootService: guestbook
      
      # Analysis - automated metrics-based promotion/rollback (Week 10+)
